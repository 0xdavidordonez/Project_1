# Quantitative Analysis of Bitcoin Prices and Currency Derivatives Correlation

## I. Executive Summary (Jeanel)

### A. Brief Overview
The convergence of traditional and digital assets is a focal point in modern financial markets. This project conducts a quantitative analysis to explore correlations between currency derivatives and Bitcoin prices. Open interest and average daily turnover metrics will be analyzed.

### B. Purpose
Derivatives hedge against price volatility and risks associated with underlying asset values. While Bitcoin typically correlates inversely with sovereign currency, its volatility necessitates risk management. The aim is to determine if cryptocurrency prices can inform decision-making, risk management, and strategic planning in currency trading.

## II. Introduction

### A. Background
Bitcoin's significance in financial markets impacts liquidity. Derivatives protect portfolios by predicting uncertainty. The analysis optimizes Bitcoin price discovery, correlating with exchange-traded contracts and options for sovereign currencies.

### B. Rationale
Despite SEC approvals for Bitcoin ETPs, decentralization introduces uncertainty. The analysis seeks efficiency in understanding Bitcoin prices and their correlation with derivatives. Opportunities arise in both long and short positions, mitigating risks related to market trends and regulatory changes.

## III. Objectives

The objectives include quantifying Bitcoin prices against derivatives volume, identifying risks, and exploring trading opportunities. Purchasing derivative contracts during Bitcoin price declines may offset losses and yield gains in sovereign wealth exchanges.

## IV. Methodology (Krashawn)

### A. Data Collection
API from [Coinglass](https://coinglass.com/) was used for exchange analysis. Statistical data from [BIS](https://stats.bis.org/) for comprehensive datasets.

### B. Analysis Techniques
- Derivatives-Specific Metrics: Open Interest, Volume, Funding Rates.
- Correlation Analysis: Evaluate relationships between Bitcoin derivatives and sovereign currency.

### C. Tools Used
- Python libraries: pandas, Geoplot, GeoViews, hvPlot, Matplotlib.
- Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment.

## V. Bitcoin Price Analysis (David)

### A. Historical Performance
Explore Bitcoin's milestones, from inception to recent highs, analyzing external factors influencing its value.

### B. Technical Analysis
Utilize moving averages, RSI, and MACD for insights into market conditions and potential price movements.

### C. Fundamental Analysis
Examine Bitcoin's technological foundations, focusing on its blockchain, deflationary algorithm, and scalability solutions.

## VI. Exchange Trade Derivatives Analysis (Jeanel)

### A. Overview
Analyze exchange-traded derivatives statistics, focusing on open interest and trends in futures and options.

### B. Opportunities
Identify opportunities in volatility arbitrage and price differentials across exchanges for risk-free profits.
